# Resources

This resources directory contains a template `README.md` and example `datapackage.json` snippets.

### `README.md` template

In this repository, each data package must have a `README.md`. The `README.md` should follow [good practices](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/publish-faq/#readme).

Use the [`README-template.md`](README-template.md) to kick start writing a `README.md` for your data package.

*To Do. Update good practices to include ideas from [Data Curator](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/blob/develop/test/features/tools/sample-provenance-information.md) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat?at=5a58aff461a861c92704fb38)*

### `datapackage.json` snippets

JSON snippets provide a fragment of a `datapackage.json` file to help you learn about that specific property or cut and paste into your own data package. E.g. `licenses.json` could include JSON for each [recommended Open Definition conformant  license](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/#conformant-licenses).
