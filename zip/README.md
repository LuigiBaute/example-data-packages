## Zipped Data Packages

This directory contains zipped versions of data packages in this repository.

It is planned that with each commit to the repository, the data package directory is converted into a data-package-directory-name.zip file so it can be used with [software that supports Frictionless Data ](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) such as the [Data Curator](http://data-curator.io) app or the [DataPackage.js](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-js) library.
